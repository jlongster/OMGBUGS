#About
The Semantic Grid System is a modern approach to the CSS grid. It allows you to set column and gutter widths, choose the number of columns, and switch between pixels and percentages, and achieve responsive layouts, all without any ugly .grid_x classes in your markup. It is powered by [LESS.js](http://lesscss.org/).

It lives on the web at [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/).
