OMGBUGS is a node.js-powered web interface to Bugzilla. It helps you
view bugs in many different ways, and has a few editing features as
well. This is not meant to replace Bugzilla, and you still need to do
heavy editing in Bugzilla.

THIS PROJECT USES HIGHCHARTS, AN AWESOME LIBRARY MADE BY Torstein
HÃ¸nsi. IT COMES BUNDLED WITH OMGBUGS AND MAY NOT BE USED FOR
COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. SEE http://www.highcharts.com/license.
